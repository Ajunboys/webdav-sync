# webdav-sync

Sync a local directory with a WebDAV server.

This tool was created because I wanted an alternative method to work
with the Demandware e-commerce platform without requiring their
IDE UX Studio which uses WebDAV to push the code to the development server.

### Dependencies

This applications requires a local copy of curl.

### Installation

    npm install webdav-sync

### Usage

#### From the command line

Show help:

    webdav-sync -h

    Options:
      --remote_base  URL for the remote endpoint            [required]
      --local_base   Path to the local directory            [required]
      --username     Username for secure login              [optional]
      --password     Password for secure login              [optional]
      --curl         Default curl command                   [default: "curl --insecure -s -S"]
      --ignored      Comma separated list of ignored paths  [default: ".hg,.git,.svn,.DS_Store"]
      --verbose      Makes webdav-sync more talkative with complete curl command and timestamp
      --help, -h     Displays this help


Syncing /var/src/code with https://user:pass@demandware.com/webdav/cartridge/

    webdav-sync --local_base /var/src/code --remote_base "https://user:pass@demandware.com/webdav/"


    webdav-sync --local_base /Users/bermi/personal/code/webdav-sync --remote_base "http://192.168.99.100:8888/webdav/" --username test --password test --verbose


#### From node.js

You can also include webdav-sync into your node app

    var options = {
        local_base: "/var/src/code",
        remote_base: "https://user:pass@demandware.com/webdav/",
        username: "option@lUsern@me",
        password: "option@lP@ssword"
    };
    var sync = (require('webdav-sync'))(options);
    sync.start();


### Development

Simply execute `cake dev` to start continuous compilation. You may also want to run `npm link` so that whenever you call `require('webdav-sync')` it will always point to the current dev version.

### Change log

 - 0.1.1: First release
 - 0.2.4: Upgrading to node 0.6.x
 - 0.3.0: Cleanup and --verbose flag added
 - 0.4.0: Minor update due to change in stdout: File transfer fixes, connection test, transfer status icons
